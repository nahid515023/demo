# Key Features:

### Native Token System
- ArtBlock introduces a platform-native token, available for purchase with a fixed price of ether.
- Users can utilize ArtBlock tokens to create new communities, each with a unique native token reflecting the community's defined properties.

### Community Governance
- To publish art products, creators must stake a specific amount of community native tokens.
- Two types of products can be published: exclusive and general.
- Community members holding native tokens participate in a democratic vote to approve or reject submissions, with voting weight determined by token holdings.

### Auction Mechanism
- Exclusive items undergo a Dutch auction, allowing creators to set starting prices, decrement amounts, timing, and minimum prices.
- General items are sold directly on the marketplace, with creators setting prices in the community native token.

### NFT Minting and Resell Market
- Approved exclusive items are minted as NFTs for sale if the majority vote is positive.
- A resell market enables users to set resale prices, with original creators receiving a royalty on each subsequent resale.

ArtBlock combines blockchain technology, decentralized governance, and a vibrant marketplace to foster a dynamic ecosystem where creators and community members actively shape the platform's evolution. Join ArtBlock and revolutionize the way art communities collaborate, create, and thrive.
